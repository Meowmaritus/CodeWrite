# CodeWrite
A clone/alternative to ASMWiiRd.

Advantages over ASMWiiRd:
* Support for easy shortcuts like Crtl+A, Crtl+N, Crtl+S, Crtl+Shift+S, Crtl+O
* Confirms file discard with a popup
* Saves the insertion address to the .asm file and reloads it on re-open for convenience

Just little things, really. I may add more features if I think of any useful ones. I might also rewrite this using GtkD instead of Tcl/Tk bindings due to how old and clunky the framework is.
